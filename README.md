Below, I describe how to fulfill the necessary components for completing this project

**How to install requirements for the project**

The requirements for this project are the following libraries (via terminal):

1.) pandas library (to load, filter, and save dataset) --> used in 'get_data.py', 'clean_data.py', 'run_analysis.py', 'visualize_results.py'
loaded via rendering statement in terminal 'import pandas' (as pd)

2.) import requests module to retrieve webpage --> used in 'get_data.py.'
loaded via rendering statement in terminal 'import requests'

3.) # import JSON module to relay API responses and work with JSON-formatted files --> used in 'get_data.py', 'clean_data.py.'
loaded via rendering statement in terminal 'import json'

4.) import numpy library (for mathematical functions: linear algebra, random numbers) --> used in 'run_analysis.py', 
loaded via rendering statement in terminal 'import numpy' (as np)

5.) Import the matplotlib library for visualization of plotting
loaded via rendering statement in terminal 'import matplotlib' (as plt) --> used in 'visualize_results.py.'


**How to run the code**

In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the project folder is located. This can be done by utilizing the 'cd' terminal command, which stands for 'change directory'.
for example:

"cd /Users/mariakalaitzidis/Documents/USC/Fall2025Courses/DSCI510/FinalProject/MP_FinalProject"

For each required code block of this project, one would navigate to the following directories in the terminal


1.) To retrieve and run 'get_data.py', navigate to the following directory using the path below:

"cd /Users/mariakalaitzidis/Documents/USC/Fall2025Courses/DSCI510/FinalProject/MP_FinalProject/data/raw"

To run the 'get_data.py' file, type the following in the terminal ("python", followed by the file you wish to run):

"python get_data.py"


2.) To retrieve and run 'clean_data.py', navigate to the following directory using the path below:

"cd /Users/mariakalaitzidis/Documents/USC/Fall2025Courses/DSCI510/FinalProject/MP_FinalProject/data/processed"

To run the 'clean_data.py' file, type the following in the terminal ("python", followed by the file you wish to run):

"python clean_data.py"


3.) To retrieve and run 'run_analysis.py', navigate to the following directory using the path below:

"cd /Users/mariakalaitzidis/Documents/USC/Fall2025Courses/DSCI510/FinalProject/MP_FinalProject/src"

To run the 'run_analysis.py' file, type the following in the terminal ("python", followed by the file you wish to run):

"python run_analysis.py"

4.) To retrieve and run 'visualize_results.py', navigate to the following directory using the path below

"cd /Users/mariakalaitzidis/Documents/USC/Fall2025Courses/DSCI510/FinalProject/MP_FinalProject/src"

To run the 'visualize_results.py' file, type the following in the terminal ("python", followed by the file you wish to run):

"python visualize_results.py"

**how to get the data**

To obtain the Dartmouth Early Warning Project Risk Forecasting data necessary for this project, navigate to the following website: https://earlywarningproject.ushmm.org/reports-and-downloads
Next, under "Downloads", locate the abnner entitled "All 2025-26 Data (CSV)". Under that banner, click "All worldwide data," and a CSV file of global risk forecasts will be automatically
downloaded.

To obtain the World Bank API data necessary for this project, navigate to the following website: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-about-the-indicators-api-documentation
Next, under the "About the Indicators API," there will be a hyperlinked "Basic Call Structure," clicking this will take the user to the webpage instructing how to construct a basic API call to the base
url ()
